# bachelor-thesis

Hi! This is the repository containing the materials I used for data analysis in my bachelor thesis. There are two folders containing files used in data collection and data analysis. There are ipynb files containing the code for data collection and analysis, and also some txt and xlsx files used in the notebooks.

The dataset in sav and xlsx formats, as well as the FastText social network model binary file may be found in Relesases: https://github.com/kmlapshina/bachelor-thesis/releases
